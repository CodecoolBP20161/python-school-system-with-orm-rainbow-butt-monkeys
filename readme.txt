Hello Dear Mentor!

In order to test our project you need to go through the following steps:
- Create a database for the project.
- Fill out the config file, also change the dbname if you gave it something else
Run the following in this order:
  - build.py
  - example_data.py
  - main.py
  - controller.py
  
Now the server should be up and running, with the basic data loaded into the database.
Our project is now ready for testing.
Have a nice day!
RBM
